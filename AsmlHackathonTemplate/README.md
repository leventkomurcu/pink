ASML Netherlands B.V. provides chipmakers with everything they need - hardware, software and services - to mass produce patterns on silicon, helping to increase the value and lower the cost of a chip. Our key technology is the lithography system, which brings together high-tech hardware and advanced software to control the chip manufacturing process down to the picometer.
All of the world’s top chipmakers like Samsung, Intel and TSMC use our technology, enabling the waves of innovation that help tackle the world’s toughest challenges.

## The ASML Digital Gold Hackathon 2018
On 12-13 October 2018 ASML is organizing a C++ Hackathon. The hackathon assignment tries to approach the daily challenges an ASML software employee faces in a:
* embedded,
* high performance,
* real time,
* distributed
system.


This project forms the basis and head-start of the ASML C++ Hackathon assignment.
